Hi, my name is Rajdeep and I am a 2nd year MTech student at IIT Kharagpur, in the Dept. of Computer Science & Engineering. I have completed my coursework in my first two semesters and am now working towards finding bugs with ML models with Prof. [Mainack Mondal](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~mainack/). 

I completed my B. Tech in Computer Science and Technology in 2023 from [IIEST SHIBPUR](https://www.iiests.ac.in/), Howrah, West Bengal, India. 

I play football and cricket and am a huge supporter of FC Barcelona. I am a die-hard fan of Messi.
