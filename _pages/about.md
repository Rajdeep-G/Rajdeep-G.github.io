Hi, I'm Rajdeep, a passionate and dedicated 2nd-year MTech student at IIT Kharagpur, specializing in Computer Science & Engineering. I have successfully completed my coursework and am currently engaged in cutting-edge research on bug detection using ML models under the guidance of Prof. [Mainack Mondal](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~mainack/). 


I hold a B.Tech degree in Computer Science and Technology from [IIEST Shibpur]((https://www.iiests.ac.in/)), where I graduated in 2023. My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in computer science principles and hands-on experience in various technologies.

Beyond academics, I am an avid sports enthusiast. I love playing football and cricket and am a devoted supporter of FC Barcelona. As a die-hard fan of Messi, I draw inspiration from his relentless pursuit of excellence.

Welcome to my portfolio website, where you can explore my projects, experiences, and interests. Feel free to reach out to me for collaborations, discussions, or just a friendly chat. I am always open to new opportunities and exciting challenges.
